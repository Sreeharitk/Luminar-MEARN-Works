React
--------

- front-end library
- Function based compononets - stateless compononets

---------------

-useState - hook used to create state in React

-props(properties) -> share data from parent to child compononet 

-Destructuring in JS
    obj = {name:"Hari",age:23}
    how we ususally call this and put it a new variable- 
        const name  = obj.name
        const age = obj.age
    By using the Destructuring method(only works if variable name is same as key name)
        const {name} = obj
        const {age} = obj
    By further simplification we can also write this as =>
        const {name,age} = obj

hooks in React
------------------
Function that let you "hook into" react state and lifecycle features from funciton compononets
 -useState- hook used to create state in react


Bonus notes
-------------

- Use "&&" instead of "?" in ternary if we only want the true case

React
--------

- front-end library
- Function based compononets - stateless compononets

---------------

types of compononets
---------------------
- class based compononets - statefull compononets(inbuild compononets) - angular
- function based compononets - stateless compononets(no inbuild compononets) - react

Data sharing in React
---------------------

Sharing data in basic react is only possible from parent to child compononets.

-state => a  js object used to store datas in react compononets
        variables in react compononets are local variables (we can update them globally)


-props(properties) -> share data from parent to child compononet 

-Destructuring in JS =>
    obj = {name:"Hari",age:23}
    how we ususally call this and put it a new variable- 
        const name  = obj.name
        const age = obj.age
    By using the Destructuring method(only works if variable name is same as key name)
        const {name} = obj
        const {age} = obj
    By further simplification we can also write this as =>
        const {name,age} = obj

hooks in React
------------------
Function that let you "hook into" react state and lifecycle features from funciton compononets

 -useState => hook used to create state in react


Bonus notes
-------------

- Use "&&" instead of "?" in ternary if we only want the true case

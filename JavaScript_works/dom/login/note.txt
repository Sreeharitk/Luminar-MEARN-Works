Local storage
--------------

to store data permenantly
storage capacity is very low
data sotred as key-value pair(objects)

 localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. 
 This means the data stored persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.

 data is stored as json/xml files since this is the universally accepted format

 C - Create - adds a new data - localStorage.setItem(key,value)
 R - Read - access an already existing data - localStorage.getItem(key)
 U - Update - manupulate an already existing data - localStorage.setItem(key,value)
 D - Delete - delete an already existing data - localStorage.removeItem(key)

 js to json - JSON.stringify(data)
 json to js - JSON.parse(data)

 Session storage(most secure among these 3)
 ---------------
Session storage allows you to store data in the browser depending on the system memory and the data stored in the browser until the browser is closed.
In other words, closing the browser will clear all the data stored in session storage.
 C - Create - sessionStorage.setItem(key,value)
 R - Read - sessionStorage.getItem(key)
 U - Update - sessionStorage.setItem(key,value)
 D - Delete - sessionStorage.removeItem(key)

Cookies
-------
4kb storage space per domain
These are server related data(send or recieve data from server)
automatically expires or user deletes the data

---------------
-> in localStorage we only data that is specific to that system or
   system user and data which is not deleted like upon logging out.

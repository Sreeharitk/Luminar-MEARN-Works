some - we get true or false as output using condition(eg:- Checking if an element is present in an array or not)

includes - checking elements directly using an element instead of a condition(return true or false) - only works on single array not on nested arrays

forEach - Same working as map() method but output will be sperate elements instead of an array(map is usually better)

flat - This used to convert a nested array into a single array - to apply flat multiple time we need to give depth (eg:- flat(2))

OOPS - Object Oriented Programming
----------------------------------
JS - Has procedural programming - Function Based
   - Has Object Oriented programming - class based / object based programming

Important things to know in OOPS
--------------------------------
Class     - Acts as a blueprint for the object
Object    - A real-world entity created using class
Reference - a variable which is used to store objects

constructor
inheritence
polymorphism
abstraction
encapsulation

instance variable - if we want to use the variable in multiple methods in a class. (we use "this" keyword to set instance variables)

Class attributes - can be accessed by all the methods in the class and do not required to be input field while calling the object method

constructor - to initilize an object at the time of object creation (constructor()- inbuilt method)
